<div class="question">
    <h2 id="afforestation">4. Why afforestation is required?</h2>
    <p>Afforestation, the large-scale planting of trees, is crucial for environmental health for several
        reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Combating Climate Change:</strong> Trees act as carbon sinks, absorbing carbon
            dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere. Planting trees helps mitigate
            climate change by reducing the amount of CO2 in the air.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Air Quality:</strong> Trees act as natural air filters, removing pollutants
            and dust particles from the air. This improves air quality and reduces respiratory problems.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Soil Conservation:</strong> Tree roots hold soil particles together, preventing
            erosion by wind and water. This protects fertile topsoil and reduces sedimentation in rivers
            and streams.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulating Water Cycle:</strong> Forests play a vital role in the water cycle. Trees
            intercept rainwater, allowing it to slowly infiltrate the soil. This helps replenish
            groundwater reserves and regulates stream flow, reducing the risk of floods and droughts.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Forests provide habitat for a wide variety of plants and
            animals. Afforestation helps restore lost habitats and promotes biodiversity.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Forests provide timber, fruits, nuts, and other
            resources that contribute to the economy. They also support tourism and recreation
            activities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall, afforestation is a vital tool for creating a healthier and more sustainable environment
        for ourselves and future generations. </p>

    <h2 id="EVS-ecosystem">5. Discuss Ecosystem</h2>
    <p>An ecosystem is a complex system where living organisms (plants, animals, and microbes) interact
        with each other and their non-living environment. These interactions create a flow of energy and
        cycling of nutrients within the system. Here&#39;s a breakdown of the key components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Biotic Components:</strong> These are all the living things within the ecosystem,
            including:<ul>
                <li><strong>Producers:</strong> Organisms that capture energy from the sun through
                    photosynthesis (like plants and algae) and form the base of the food chain.</li>
                <li><strong>Consumers:</strong> Organisms that obtain energy by consuming other
                    organisms. They can be further categorized as:<ul>
                        <li>Herbivores: Consume only plants.</li>
                        <li>Carnivores: Consume only animals.</li>
                        <li>Omnivores: Consume both plants and animals.</li>
                        <li>Decomposers: Break down dead organic matter and return nutrients to the
                            ecosystem.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Abiotic Components:</strong> These are the non-living physical and chemical factors
            that influence life in the ecosystem, including:<ul>
                <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Temperature, precipitation, sunlight, and wind.</li>
                <li><strong>Soil:</strong> Provides nutrients and support for plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Water:</strong> Essential for all living things and shapes aquatic
                    ecosystems.</li>
                <li><strong>Landforms:</strong> Mountains, rivers, lakes, etc., influence the
                    distribution of organisms.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Key Ecosystem Processes:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Energy Flow:</strong> Energy enters the ecosystem through sunlight captured by
            producers and flows through the food chain as consumers eat each other.</li>
        <li><strong>Nutrient Cycling:</strong> Nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon are
            essential for life and are cycled through the ecosystem as organisms decompose, die, and
            become part of the soil.</li>
        <li><strong>Habitat:</strong> The specific area where an organism lives and finds the resources
            it needs to survive and reproduce.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Types of Ecosystems:</strong></p>
    <p>Ecosystems can be broadly classified into two main types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Terrestrial Ecosystems:</strong> Land-based ecosystems like forests, grasslands,
            deserts, and tundra.</li>
        <li><strong>Aquatic Ecosystems:</strong> Water-based ecosystems like oceans, lakes, rivers,
            estuaries, and wetlands.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Importance of Ecosystems:</strong></p>
    <p>Ecosystems provide a variety of essential services for humans and all living things, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Food production:</strong> Ecosystems provide the foundation for agriculture and
            fisheries.</li>
        <li><strong>Clean air and water:</strong> Healthy ecosystems help purify air and water.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate regulation:</strong> Ecosystems play a role in regulating global climate by
            absorbing carbon dioxide.</li>
        <li><strong>Biodiversity:</strong> Healthy ecosystems support a diverse range of life forms.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Recreation:</strong> Ecosystems provide opportunities for recreation and enjoyment
            of nature.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Understanding ecosystems is crucial for promoting environmental sustainability and protecting the
        delicate balance of life on Earth.</p>
