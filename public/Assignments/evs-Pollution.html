<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Acknowledgement" id="ack">2. Acknowledgement</h2>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude to [Name/Organization], whose invaluable support and resources made this report
    possible. Special thanks to the local environmental agencies and community members who provided data and insights
    into the water pollution issues in [Your Local Area].</p>

<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Objectives" id="obje">3. Objective</h2>
<p>The primary objective of this report is to analyze the water pollution in [Your Local Area] by:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying the types and sources of pollution.</li>
    <li>Assessing the impact on the environment and public health.</li>
    <li>Proposing viable solutions and preventive measures to mitigate pollution.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Types and Sources" id="type-source">4. Types and Sources</h2>
<h3>Types of Water Pollution:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Chemical Pollution:</strong> Involves the presence of harmful chemicals such as pesticides, heavy
        metals, and industrial chemicals.</li>
    <li><strong>Biological Pollution:</strong> Caused by pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, and parasites.</li>
    <li><strong>Physical Pollution:</strong> Includes the introduction of physical contaminants like plastics,
        sediments, and thermal pollution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources of Water Pollution:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Industrial Discharge:</strong> Factories and plants discharge pollutants directly into water bodies.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Agricultural Runoff:</strong> Use of fertilizers and pesticides in farming leads to runoff into rivers
        and lakes.</li>
    <li><strong>Sewage and Wastewater:</strong> Improperly treated sewage and household wastewater enter water systems.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Urban Runoff:</strong> Rainwater runoff from streets and urban areas carries pollutants into nearby
        water bodies.</li>
    <li><strong>Illegal Dumping:</strong> Direct disposal of waste and chemicals into rivers and lakes.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Effects" id="effects">5. Effects</h2>
<h3>Environmental Impact:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Ecosystem Disruption:</strong> Pollutants harm aquatic life, leading to loss of biodiversity.</li>
    <li><strong>Eutrophication:</strong> Excess nutrients cause algal blooms, depleting oxygen levels and killing fish.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Water Quality Degradation:</strong> Makes water bodies unfit for recreational and commercial use.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Health Impact:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Waterborne Diseases:</strong> Contaminated water leads to diseases such as cholera, dysentery, and
        hepatitis.</li>
    <li><strong>Toxic Exposure:</strong> Long-term exposure to polluted water can cause serious health issues, including
        cancer and reproductive problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Prevention and Solution" id="prevention">6. Solution / Prevention</h2>
<h3>Preventive Measures:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Improved Waste Treatment:</strong> Upgrading sewage and industrial waste treatment facilities.</li>
    <li><strong>Regulation and Enforcement:</strong> Strict enforcement of environmental laws and regulations.</li>
    <li><strong>Public Awareness:</strong> Educating the community about the causes and effects of water pollution.</li>
    <li><strong>Sustainable Farming Practices:</strong> Encouraging the use of organic farming and reducing chemical
        usage.</li>
    <li><strong>Green Infrastructure:</strong> Implementing rain gardens, permeable pavements, and other green
        infrastructure to reduce runoff.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Solutions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Water Quality Monitoring:</strong> Regular monitoring and reporting of water quality data.</li>
    <li><strong>Pollution Control Technologies:</strong> Adopting advanced technologies for pollution control in
        industries.</li>
    <li><strong>Reforestation and Riparian Buffers:</strong> Planting trees and vegetation along water bodies to filter
        pollutants.</li>
    <li><strong>Clean-Up Drives:</strong> Organizing community clean-up events to remove trash and debris from local
        water bodies.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="summary" data-summary="Conclusion" id="conclusion">7. Conclusion</h2>
